Welcome to the Abhishek's Data Module assignment!
In this module, you will see two SQL files: store_db and data_dig.
In the first file, I have created a database for a typical grocery store and assigned values such as the product, item, price and quantity. 
In the second file, I have a database for NFL players within a draft class. After inputting the data into a table, I was able to perform queries on the data to order the picks by position, college, and their pick number. 
This assignment allowed me to understand how database relationships work together and how to derive insights from related data.
